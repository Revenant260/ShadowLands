* #help to get started

## > Some FAQ <
> "How are the chat logs stored?": Simple, localy to your device, clear the cache on your browser and poof gone. **but so is your userprofile**
> "Are you some hacker trying to steal my things?": No, im a very small devloper dipping my toes in the water, all i want to do is see the thing work.
> "How good is the censorship?": None tbh, so by joining you accpect the risk of a ```NSFW ENVIROMENT```, procced at your own risk.
> "Will there be censorship?": Depends on how you define where the msgs are store and how volatile the space is, they are cached on your device localy.
> "Will there be moderation?": I soon want to create moderation tools per room owner, but for now it will be qoute, chaos.

> Also if your seeing this page instead of the site after clicking the link, im prolly working on it.
